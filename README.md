# BootstrapStatistics

If frequentism is about using assumptions and theoretical results to calculate what we expect to happen were an experiment to be run again and again and again, then bootstrapping is about using computing power to essentially re-run the sample draw again and again and again to see what actually happens.


# Summary
This project analyzes medical charge data to answer business questions and see firsthand how the bootstrap method can repeat the frequentist tests (and yield consistent answers), but also use the approach to answer a question that could be answered with frequentist inference alone. What is the probabilistic distribution of the mean corresponding to the data samples were taken from?
